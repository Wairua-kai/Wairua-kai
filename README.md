- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Wairua-kai

I'm interested primarily in role playing games and coding.

RPGS: 5E, 3.5E, PF1E, PF2E and a lot of the older RPG's; especially those centered around space.

Code: .Net, C#, C++, Python, Angular, Vue, typescript, javascript, ORACLE, SQL Server, MongoDB, MySQL, and a lot of dabbling in other languages as the situation merits.
